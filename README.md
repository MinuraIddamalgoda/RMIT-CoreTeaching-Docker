# RMITCTSaaS (RMIT CoreTeaching Servers as a Service)

Almost every Bachelor of IT, CS, and SWE assingment stipulates that your code must compile on the CoreTeaching Servers or risk humiliation/death.

This presents a unique problem: I cbf yeeting my jank code onto a server just to make sure it compiles when I generally finish assignments <60 secs before it's due.

Enter my over-engineered solution: ~time management~ running containers emulating these servers as best as possible and running my code there.
